# halloween-phone
Hacky program that uses baresip, ffmpeg and pulse to dial a contact and inject a wav file into the call. Used to play spooky sounds during a party.

Work in progress. No tests, no dockerfile. Hacked together with very limited
time.

* Needs a working baresip installation with a contact `target`.
* Needs working pulseaudio.
